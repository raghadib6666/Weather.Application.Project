# Weather.Application.Projectüå¶Ô∏è

The Weather App is designed to provide weather information for different 
locations. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, viewers can manage their locations, 
retrieve weather details, and stay informed about temperature, humidity, wind Speed, and conditions!

## Future Work:

**User Interface (UI):**
<br> Develop a user-friendly web interface or mobile app to allow users to interact with the application visually. Use modern frontend frameworks like React or Angular for a responsive and dynamic user experience.

**Historical Weather Data:**
<br> Extend the application to store and provide historical weather data. Implement features to allow users to view past weather conditions for specific locations.

**Notifications and Alerts:**
<br> Integrate a notification system to alert users about conditions weather changes or updates for their specified locations. This could include email alerts, push notifications, or SMS notifications.
